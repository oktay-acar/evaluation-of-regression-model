# Evaluation of Regression Model

### Project Tasks

### Task: 
Employees' years of experience and salary information are given.

| Years of Experience *(x)* | Salary *(y)* |
| :---------------------: | :--------: |
|            5            |    600     |
|            7            |    900     |
|            3            |    550     |
|            3            |    500     |
|            2            |    400     |
|            7            |    950     |
|            3            |    540     |
|           10            |    1200    |
|            6            |    900     |
|            4            |    550     |
|            8            |    1100    |
|            1            |    460     |
|            1            |    400     |
|            9            |    1000    |
|            1            |    380     |

**Step 1:** Create the linear regression model equation according to the given bias and weight. 

*(y' = b+wx)*
- **Bias:** 275, **Weight:** 90 

**Step 2:** Estimate the salary for all years of experience in the table according to the model equation you have created.

**Step 3:** Calculate **MSE**, **RMSE**, **MAE** scores to measure the success of the model.
